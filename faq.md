# Anti-Racism @ Work FAQ

## What is this space for?
* This space is for anyone who is interested in becoming anti-racist, especially white people
* You are welcome no matter how much you know about anti-racist work

## How can I participate in this space?
* Be candid + be curious. Impact matters over intention. If you see something you don’t agree with, state your disagreement, welcome the chance to become more educated, and to learn about the ways your impact may not be mirroring your intention.
* It is not wrong not to know much about this movement, but it is wrong to reject the learning others share with you.

# Should I be worried about saying the “wrong” thing?
* Nope! You will get the most value from this space by sharing your honest thoughts. However, be ready for others to share with you how you can become more anti-racist. Sometimes that may bring up feelings of anger, shame, and guilt. That is okay. This is a safe environment to move through those feelings w/out burdening POC or BIPOC (black, indigenous people of color)
* Who is in charge here?
* Everyone. Anti-racism work requires multi-faceted, distributed communities, not single leader movements. Keep yourself accountable. Use kindness and common sense when communicating only in slack. Expect people to mess up, and expect them to want to do better.
* If you have specific concerns, message Savannah, the workspace admin.

# Why am I hearing about other social issues like misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, etc?
* Racism is one part of a constellation of social issues. They are all linked. Sometimes talking about racism requires talking about these other related issues. Same principles apply, be curious, and be kind.

# Why can’t I edit messages after 5 min or delete them?
* This is a learning space, as such, it’s important to be transparent about when we’d like to go back and revise past statements. It’s also important to be intentional when communicating here and not rely on the ability to go back and edit or delete statements after the fact.
